üê∂üê± Cats vs Dogs Image Classification

This project is a deep learning model that classifies images as either cats or dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). It's a classic computer vision problem and a great beginner project for learning image classification using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Built a CNN using TensorFlow/Keras
- Preprocessed image data using `ImageDataGenerator`
- Achieved over 85% validation accuracy
- Visualized training history (accuracy and loss curves)
Tools Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
